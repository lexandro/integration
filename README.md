# AppDirect integration PoC

## Intro

Sample app to demonstrate AppDirect integration by Robert Stern based on Java 8, MongoDB and Spring Boot.


## How to build
Prerequisites: The application needs to be built with Maven 3.0.4++, Java 8, MongoDB and uses Lombok to generate setter/getters etc. Please have a look on https://projectlombok.org/ to see how is your IDE supported.  

To build:
```
    $ mvn clean package
```

Building the Docker image
```
    cd app
    docker build -t <your repo>/imaginarium .
```
     
## Deploy/run

### Preparation
Java app is available on localhost:8080 and the passed security settings is mandatory for some virtualized environment, otherwise the startup takes 30 mins o.O.
To run the app you could configure your MongoDB access or use the following I generated for reviewers (that differs from my dev instance):
```
  mongodb://appdirect:Test-2015@ds027698.mongolab.com:27698/imaginarium-dev
```

### Credentials 
The consumer key and secret is already provided in <proj root>/app/src/main/resources/application.yml 

### Run
```
    java -DMONGO_URI=<mongodb connection string> -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom -jar imaginarium.jar
```

Docker image exposes the app on port 80 and you just need to pull it from the public hub:
```
    docker pull lexandro/imaginarium // optional
    docker run -dt --name 'imaginarium' -e MONGO_URI=<mongodb connection string> -p 80:8080 lexandro/imaginarium java -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom -jar imaginarium.jar
```     

## Delivery pipeline
The app has a fully automated build pipeline on: http://ci.lexandro.com/

At the moment the sonar step is demonstrational to show how the automated code quality check could be integrated into the process. The pipeline is
autogenerated from DSL script as a bootstrap job and depending only on some settings, but not a dedicated jenkins server. The pipeline source code 
could be found here:
